PHP Code Flow - What Included What ?  What Called What ? - Made Easy

If you're like me you're working with included files and functions and when things get complicated it's hard to go back to your years old code and figure out how it all came together.   I decided to create some functionality to make that job easier.  Perhaps it will make it easier for you too!

Note: I have addressed 
* Files / Included files
* Functions
* Variables

  I have not tested on classes so this may need a fork to address these
